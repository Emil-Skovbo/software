# Assignment #3 - Sequences and recursion -  Towers of Hanoi


We have chosen to make the part of the assignment about Towers of Hanoi. we have made multipule solutions where one is a text based solution using recursion to move alle the discs to their destination. this file is named Hanoi.java and is based on the Geeksforgeeks solution.

Our Secound solution is in the guiTowerOfHanoi folder where we used a gui based solution we found when investegating possible solutions.

The last solution is a visual text based solution where we use a scanner to take a user input for how many disks there should be on the tower of hanoi. We use the stack class in this solution as part of the recursive code.
