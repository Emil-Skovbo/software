# Mini Project #1 - Sorting Shakespeareâ€™s complete works Algorithms and Data Structures

For this assignment i have only been able to make Merge and insertion sort work as it should. Selection sort also seems to work but takes multiple hours to finish and therefore i do not have a estimate on the run time.

the run time for merge sort was 2787 milliseconds 
insertion sort took longer then an hour and i stopped it.
heapsort took 2715 milliseconds but does not work as intended. 
trie i never understood.
